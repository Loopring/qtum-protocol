##Environment Setup

Begin by Installing Docker.

You should then run either DockerEnvironmentSetupUnix.sh (mac/linux) or DockerEnvironmentSetupWindows.bat(windows)
via the terminal after changing current working directory to the project root.

Once you have setup the test environment, you should run StartNodesUnix.sh (mac/linux) or StartNodesWindows.bat(windows)
in order to launch the local test network.
